# hotel-management-system

I developed a comprehensive script for managing a hotel management database system. This involved creating tables for room, customers, and booking, each with their respective attributes such as ID, name, adress, payment method, checking_in_date and checking_out_date. Leveraging SQL queries, I efficiently inserted, updated, and queried data to ensure the integrity and smooth functioning of the database. Notably, I implemented advanced features such as foreign key constraints, data truncation, and modification of column properties to optimize database performance and maintain consistency. This project not only honed my proficiency in SQL but also showcased my ability to design and manage complex database systems to meet organizational needs effectively.
